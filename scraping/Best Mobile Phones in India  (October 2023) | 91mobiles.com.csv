The phone basically tries to offer best of both worlds and in many departments, does it successfully. OnePlus Nord 2 is a perfect phone for you if you're looking at a phone that offers a clean UI, supports 5G connectivity, takes decent images, and offers good battery life. While the phone doesn't excel in one particular area, it tries to cover most aspects.","Octa core (3 GHz, Single Core + 2.6 GHz, Tri core + 2 GHz, Quad core)
